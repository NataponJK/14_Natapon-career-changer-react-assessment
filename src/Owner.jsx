          Hi, I'm James. I used to study psychology before the world decided to
          take a weird turn. It upgrade me to Leakage Technician. But wait,
          There's more! Life threw me another curveball, and here I am,
          attempting to decode the secrets of the universe through the mystical
          art of coding.
